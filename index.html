                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>
                            My name is Peter Carmichael. I am a software developer currently enrolled at Code Fellows in Seattle. For the past decade I have been a chef working at amazing restuarants all around the country. I've worked in everything from fine dining to small causual restaurants. The change to software development has come from a desire to better myself and my future. I am very passionate about deisgn and creativity so I would love to work in a primarily front end design job focusing on UX. Software is fascinating to me and I am excited to turn it into an amazing career.</p>
                        <p>
                            I was born in Hawaii in the city of Kailua in 1992. While my family was living there my father was working for a company called Aspect that created and developed a technology called ASP. Currently that language has evolved into ASP.net. I was raised in a environment surrounded by tech and the software industry. I have always had it in the back of my mind to pursue a career in this field but over the last year the pieces have fallen into place and I have decided to go forward with bettering myself and my life. </p>
                        <p>
                            My interests other than software are vast and I consider myself a very active hobbiest. I am of course passionate about food and cooking, and I feel that my time in the hospitality industry has set me up with skills that can be applied to any industry. My other main interests are building Lego and working on my Land Rover Discovery. I have been heavily passionate about lego since I was 3 or 4 and got my first set. I have fond memories of setting up elaborate scenes with my brother and creating a narrative about our Lego and playing out scenes. Currently I consider my self a very accomplished builder and display my creations at conventions in the US and British Colombia, Canada. I use Lego as a tool to clear the mind of stress and increase my creative capacity. Working on my old Land Rover is another passion of mine. I am a very hands on person and a few years ago I decided to get a car that is known for not being the most reliable. This was the catalyst for a massive amount of learning how to do very complex repairs and modifications to cars. Before owning that car I had never done anything other than swapping brake pads and now I feel fairly confident in doing any proceedure short of a total engine swap.</p>
